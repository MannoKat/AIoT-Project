## Features

- Automated watering system
- Soil moisture monitoring
- Temperature and humidity monitoring
- Light intensity monitoring
- Automatic notifications and alerts

## Requirements

- Arduino microcontroller board
- Sensors (soil moisture sensor, temperature/humidity sensor, light sensor)
- Water pump
- Relay module (if required)
- Python environment for data analysis and visualization
- Internet connectivity for notifications (optional)

## Installation

1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Connect the sensors (soil moisture sensor, temperature/humidity sensor, light sensor) to the Arduino board.
   - Connect the water pump to the Arduino board (via a relay module if required).

2. **Software Setup:**
   - Upload the Arduino sketch (provided in `arduino_code/`) to your Arduino board.
   - Install the required Python packages by running:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Configuration:**
   - Modify the Arduino sketch and Python scripts to adjust sensor pins, thresholds, and any other parameters according to your setup and requirements.

4. **Usage:**
   - Run the Python script (`main.py`) to start the monitoring and control system.
   - Follow the prompts or GUI instructions to interact with the system.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues during setup or operation, please refer to the troubleshooting section in the project report (`project_report.pdf`).
